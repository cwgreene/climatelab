# Climate Lab
Climate lab is for creating simple, toy models of planet climates.

Sequence of goals:

## No Atmosphere, convex mesh model, blackbody
* [x] Create a spherical mesh
* [ ] Associate energy to triangles based on their normal to the light source
* [ ]  Have blackbody radiation for triangles
* [ ] Observe specific triangle's temperature with time
 * [ ] requires UI to display dashboard and select triangle.
* [ ] Perform heat disapation on triangles.
* [ ] Rotate the sphere

## No Atmosphere, cmm, albedo
* [ ] As above, allow triangles to have reflection and differing heat capacities
